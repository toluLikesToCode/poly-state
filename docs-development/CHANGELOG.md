## [Unreleased] - In Active Development

### Added

- Enhanced React example with comprehensive hook demonstrations
- Vanilla TypeScript example with complete feature showcase
- Additional npm scripts for better development workflow:
  - `lint:fix` - ESLint with automatic fixes
  - `format` - Format all files with Prettier
  - `format:check` - Check formatting without making changes
- Prettier configuration optimized for code conciseness
- TypeScript-specific Prettier overrides for maximum conciseness

### Changed

- Package name finalized as `poly-state` (pending npm publication)
- Updated README.md with comprehensive React examples showing advanced hooks
- Enhanced React example (`examples/react.tsx`) with:
  - Counter component with undo/redo functionality
  - User profile with transactions and path updates
  - Todo list with async thunks and loading states
  - Settings with theme switching and store effects
- Improved vanilla TypeScript example (`examples/vanilla.ts`) with:
  - Async thunk demonstrations
  - Transaction examples
  - Path updates and batch operations
  - History management (undo/redo)
  - Complete API coverage
- Prettier configuration updated for maximum code conciseness:
  - Removed semicolons (`"semi": false`)
  - Reduced trailing commas (`"trailingComma": "es5"`)
  - Increased line width to 120 characters
  - Removed bracket spacing
  - Removed arrow function parentheses for single parameters
- ESLint configuration simplified to resolve compatibility issues
- Enhanced documentation with complete hooks reference

### Fixed

- ESLint configuration errors by simplifying extends configuration
- TypeScript compilation errors in example files
- Inconsistent import paths in documentation and examples
- Missing Prettier dependency in package.json
- Type error in prototype-pollution checks by guarding string-only keys in updatePath (prevents
  unintended number vs. string comparisons) – src/core/state/createStore.ts

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive React hooks documentation covering all 16 available hooks
- Enhanced quick start examples with more realistic use cases
- Improved development setup documentation with example file descriptions
- Updated all code examples to reflect new concise formatting style
