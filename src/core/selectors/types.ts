 * - Multiple async invocations can overlap; add your own guards/queues if ordering matters.
 *
 * Prefer thunks or middleware for async flows that need ordering, cancellation, or centralized
 * error handling coordinated with state changes.

 * ```typescript
 * const listener: DependencyListener<string> = (newName, oldName) => {
